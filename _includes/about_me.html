            I am a recent new grad from California State Monterey Bay with a bachelors in science. I studied
            computer science with a concentration in software enginering. I have gained lots of experience 
            picking up and effectively using new technologies. I am looking forward to future challenges and 
            excited to get started in the industy.

           I love solving problems.
           While in school I was an active member of the programming club. The club hosted multiple coding
           compeitions a week and I even went with them to compete in the 2018 ICPC Pacific Northwest Regional
           programming contest. I'm looking for a role in which I can apply my problem solving skills and continue
           to grow as a programmer.
