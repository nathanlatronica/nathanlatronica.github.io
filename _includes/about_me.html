            I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing,
            and async mechanisms).

            I am a recent new grad from California State Monterey Bay with a bachelors in science. I studied
            computer science with a concentration in software enginering.

           I love solving problems.
           While in school I was an active member of the programming club. The club hosted multiple coding
           compeitions a week and I even went with them to compete in the 2018 ICPC Pacific Northwest Regional
           programming contest. I'm looking for a role in which I can apply my problem solving skills and continue
           to grow as a programmer.
